ArrayCW1 ::Input some numbers , find average & check how many numbers are
greater than the average & show them .

ArrayCW2 :: Enter some days temperature and show how many & which
 temperature are higher than previous day.
 
ArrayCW3 :: Enter 2 semesters marks & show which semister is harder.

ArrayCW4 :: Enter 2 semesters students marks & show hwo many students improved
and which student improved how many narks improved.

ArrayCW5 :: Enter 5 numbers & show even numbers seperately using 
another array & also find sum of even numbers.
